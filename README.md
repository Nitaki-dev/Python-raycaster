Here is a simple 3D* raycaster I made that works on all Numworks calculators!<br>
Insider is a 3D game where you need to escape a haunted hotel
(This is just a demo so there is no real gameplay, you just need to reach specific coordinates) <br> <br>
This was inspired by [Spooky's jump scare mansion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/356670/Spookys_Jump_Scare_Mansion/) (all rights reserved)
and is used as a demo to showcase the 3D* raycaster I made.<br><br>
You can move using the UP and DOWN arrow keys and
look left or right with the LEFT or RIGHT arrow keys.<br>
You can also change the drawing accuracy (change the res variable at line 34) to a higher value if the game is too slow.<br> <br>
*it’s technically 2.5D but most people call it 3D*<br> <br>
[Install it here](https://my.numworks.com/python/nitaki/insider_3d/edit)
*Also, most of this code was written at inconvenient times to if there are any spelling/grammar mistakes please let me know**
